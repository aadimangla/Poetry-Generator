[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](images/product.png)

Automatically generate imaginative poetry using your own ideas. It generates poetry with resemblance to Shakespeare's poetry by only taking a line or words as an input from the user. It has proven to give quite good poems.

Here's why:
* To implement deep learning models 
* To check how creative AI could be
* To have fun with AI

NLP is a branch of data science that consists of systematic processes for analyzing, understanding, and deriving information from the text data in a smart and efficient manner. By utilizing NLP and its components, one can organize the massive chunks of text data, perform numerous automated tasks and solve a wide range of problems such as – automatic summarization, machine translation, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and topic segmentation etc.
